Predictive & Anomaly Detection for TeeChart

Steema Numerics is a new suite of .NET 5.0 assemblies designed to facilitate the integration of Machine Learning in the analaysis of your data. Core functionality revolves around Anomaly Detection and Data Prediction, and the suite is divided into three assemblies: the engine, which uses Microsoft's ML.NET for its calculations, a ChartHelper designed for use with TeeChart, and a Windows Forms assembly containing Editors for some of the operations.

To be able to build and run the examples here you'll need to use Steema Numerics, Steema.Numerics.Windows and Steema.Numerics.ChartHelper assemblies.
