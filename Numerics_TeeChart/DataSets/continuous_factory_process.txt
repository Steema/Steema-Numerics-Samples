Context
This data was taken from an actual production line near Detroit, Michigan. The goal is to predict certain properties of the line's output from the various input data. The line is a high-speed, continuous manufacturing process with parallel and series stages.

Content
The data comes from one production run spanning several hours. Liveline Technologies has a large quantity of this type of data from multiple production lines in various locations.

Acknowledgements
The Liveline team would like to thank all the technicians and production personnel who assisted with the runs and data collection.

Inspiration
We are always looking for the best predictive modeling approaches to use in real time production environments. Models are employed for several use cases such as development of real time process controllers (use the models in simulation environments) and anomaly detection (compare model predictions to actual outputs in real time).

About this file
The data comes from a continuous flow manufacturing process with multiple stages. Sample rates are 1 Hz.

In the first stage, Machines 1, 2, and 3 operate in parallel, and feed their outputs into a step that combines the flows.
Output from the combiner is measured in 15 locations. These measurements are the primary measurements to predict.
Next, the output flows into a second stage, where Machines 4 and 5 process in series.
Measurements are made again in the same 15 locations. These are the secondary measurements to predict.
